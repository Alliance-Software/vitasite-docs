            "text": "Welcome to VitaSite\u2122\n\n\nVitaSite is a set of tools that enable you to take control of your website. Now you can manage this critical communication channel without having to learn the technical intricacies of how the web works. After all, you don\u2019t have to know how a modern telephone system works to use a phone to communicate in your business; and you shouldn\u2019t have to know HTML, FTP, or any other Internet technology to use the web for communication, either. VitaSite makes managing your web site easy.\n\n\nSo relax. If you know how to use a word processor then you already know most of what you need to work with VitaSite.\n\n\nVitaSite is also extremely robust and powerful. VitaSite technology is in use on sites that handle millions of page views per day. As your web needs grow, rest assured that VitaSite can handle your new requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Tools You Can Use from Anywhere\n\n\nWe built the VitaSite Content Management System (CMS) around simple, browser-based tools that you can use from any computer that has an Internet connection. In this way, you can update your website from your office, your kitchen table, or from a hotel room half way around the world. It requires no special desktop software. If you have Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, Apple Safari, or just about any other modern web browser, then you have all the software you need.\n\n\nConsistent Look \n Feel\n\n\nVitaSite maintains a consistent and professional graphical look and feel throughout your entire site. When you create or edit content, you don\u2019t have to worry about making sure it looks like the rest of your site. VitaSite automatically wraps the look and feel of your site around any new content you create, and displays that content in the standard typeface and font size chosen for your site.\n\n\nAutomatic Site Navigational Structure\n\n\nVitaSite automatically updates your site navigational options as you add and change content. If you add a page to a particular section, VitaSite updates the navigation on all the related pages so that visitors to your site can find the new page.\n\n\nVitaSite also maintains navigational aids, such as the breadcrumbs trail feature, to help your site visitors understand where they are in your site structure. This makes it easy for them to find their way back to a particular page, or to understand the structure of your site content.\n\n\nCentral data storage\n\n\nVitaSite uses a high performance SQL database (it\u2019s not necessary to know what a SQL database is). This database keeps all your content in one place, and accesses it as visitors request information from your site. If your VitaSite CMS installation is hosted on Alliance Software\u2019s servers, then we backup your content every two hours. If you host site on your organization\u2019s servers, then your IT department's site administrators controll the backup schedule.\n\n\nVitaSite does not store anything on your local hard drive unless you explicitly choose to put it there. So again, you don\u2019t have to worry about keeping track of the content you create. VitaSite takes care of that task, too.\n\n\nWe designed VitaSite to allow you to focus your energy on communicating your message, without worrying about all the other details that normally go into creating a website.\n\n\n\u201cSo, Why Do I Need this User\u2019s Guide?\u201d\n\n\nYou won\u2019t for long. However, a Users Guide helps with two things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt helps you get familiar with the organization of the tools, and become comfortable with how terminology is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt provides a reference to tools that you seldom use. You will find that you spend most of your time in the system using two or three tools. Occasionally, you will need to use one of the other tools. At those times, having a User\u2019s Guide close by is helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing the Administrative Tools\n\n\nThroughout this Users Guide it will be assumed that you have access to computer with an Internet connection, and that you are logged into your VitaSite as an administrative user.\n\n\nThe first time you visit the administrative page each day, you will be asked to log in using your username and password. For the next visit that day from the same computer, you will not need to log in.\n\n\nIf you need to explicitly log out (e.g., when you are working from a computer that others can get access to), you can click the \u201clogout\u201d link that appears in the top right corner of each administrative page. This logs you out of the system, and returns the browser to the home page of your site.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nTo get started, first you need to know whether your VitaSite installation supports a single website or multiple websites. There are instructions for both types of installations below. If you do not know this information, contact your support team for help.\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative Access on Single Site Installations\n\n\nLogging in to your VitaSite is simple: just add \u201c/admin\u201d to the end of your site URL. As an example, if your site URL were: \nhttp://www.mysite.com\n\n\nThen you would log in to your administrative tools by going to: \nhttp://www.mysite.com/admin\n\n\nAdministrative Access on Multi-site Installations\n\n\nLogging in to your VitaSite mulit-site installation takes and extra step. First, a 'shortname' is given to each sub-site underneath the main or home site. As an example, if your site 'stortname' was the word 'site' then your URL would be: \nhttp://www.mysite.com/site\n\n\nThen you would log in to your administrative tools by going to: \nhttp://www.mysite.com/site/admin\n\n\nFor access to the main site, use \nwww\n for the site's 'shortname.'\n\n\nAbout This Users Guide\n\n\nWe organized this Users Guide in the same organizational structure as the VitaSite administrative tools. Each VitaSite tool has its own section, where we explain the use of that tool. We discuss the most often used tools first. Most readers of this Users Guide will learn the bulk of what they need in the sections discussing the first three tools: \nPages\n, \nContent Items\n, and \nMedia Items\n.",

            "text": "Pages \n Content\n\n\nWith VitaSite\u2122, you organize your web site using Pages and Content. Pages are placeholders for information. \nContent\n is the information you put on those pages.\n\n\nThink of Pages as an outline of your site. The top-level is your home page. Under that you might have six or seven sub-pages that organize information about your company in a logical way. In turn, each of those sub-pages may have sub-pages under them, which further describe the information in that section.\n\n\nFor example, if we wanted to take this Users Guide and make it into a web site, then we might outline it into Pages and Sub-Pages as follows:\n\n\n\n\nHome Page\n\n\nIntroduction \n Overview\n\n\nPages \n Content\n\n\nPage Editor\n\n\nContent Items\n\n\nMedia Items\n\n\nEtc.\n\n\nEtc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might notice that the outline looks a lot like a Table of Contents. That is the point. Organizing your site into Pages and Sub-pages provides an organizational structure that makes it easy for your site visitors to find what they\u2019re looking for.\n\n\nThink of \ncontent\n as the \u201cstuff\u201d that goes on your pages. Content is usually text and images, but it can also be a streaming audio/video file, a PDF document, or something similar. Content is the message you\u2019re trying to communicate through the pages of your site.\n\n\nThe tools described in the rest of this section allow you to manipulate pages and various types of content.\n\n\nPage Editor\n\n\nThe admin uses the Page Editor tool to create pages, edit page properties, edit the content on a page, preview pages and delete pages. You can get access to the Page Editor by clicking on the \u201cPages\u201d link in the left navigation bar with the \"Content\" section on any administrative page. Alternatively, you can click on the \u201cPages\" link in the body of the main administrative screen.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nYou can see a representation of the main Page Editor screen in Figure 1. On this screen you can see all the pages in your site. The pages are arranged in a tree structure, with related pages grouped together, and with sub-pages indented under their respective parent pages. This arrangement makes it easy for you to find the page you need, and it helps you keep the content of your site organized.\n\n\nNext to each page is a group of up to five buttons. Each button performs a specific function, as follows:\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n:\n This button allows you edit the content that appears on the page.\n\n\nPreview\n:\n This allows you to preview a page and includes controls to allow for testing of a responsive website.\n\n\nProperties\n:\n This button allows you to edit the properties of the page.\n\n\nAdd Sub-Page\n:\n This button adds a sub-page under the current page.\n\n\nDelete\n:\n This button deletes the current page from the site.\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\n\nClick on the edit button to add, arrange or delete the content that appears on a specific page. When you click the button, a new browser window will open showing a representation of what the page will look like to your site visitors.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nThere are two buttons at the top of this page (see Figure 2) labeled \u201cSave\u201d and \u201cCancel.\u201d Each button performs the following function:\n\n\n\n\nSave\n \u2013 Saves any changes you have made to the page, and closes the edit window\n\n\nCancel\n \u2013 Discards any changes, and closes the edit window\n\n\n\n\nOn any given page there will be one or more areas, called content areas, which you can edit. These areas are surrounded by box with a rounded gray header, as shown in Figure 3. Inside the content area there is a toolbar associated with each content item. If no items are on the page, the tool bar only displays a plus sign( ), meaning that the only action you can take is to add an item to the page.\n\n\nOnce an item has been added, the full toolbar for that item will appear. There can be multiple items on a page, and each item will have its own toolbar. The full toolbar contains the following buttons:\n\n\n\n\nInsert a new item: This button starts the page insertion wizard, which allows you to insert content onto the page. The page insertion wizard is described more fully below.\n\n\nMove this item up: This button moves this item up in relation to any other items on the page around it.\n\n\nMove this item down: This button moves this item down in relation to any other items on the page around it.\n\n\nItem information: This button identifies the item by Group, Item Name, and Item Key.\n\n\nEdit this item: This button (which may not be available for every item type) opens the editor for that specific item type.\n\n\nRemove this item from the page: This button removes this item from the page. However, it does NOT delete the item from the system. The item can still be used on other pages.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember that changes you make using these buttons are NOT saved until you click \u201cSave\u201d or at the top of the window. This allows you to experiment with various items, without committing to those experiments until you are satisfied with the appearance of the page.\n\n\nThe Page Insertion Wizard\n\n\nThe page insertion wizard allows you to quickly locate an item that you want to insert on the page. At each step of the wizard you make a choice which narrows the options you see in the next step, leading to the last step of inserting a specific item onto the page. In this Users Guide, we will cover the page insertion wizard options that are common among all VitaSite installations. If your installation includes a plug-in, you may see additional options in the page insertion wizard.\n\n\nIn this example, we\u2019ll follow the specific options for inserting a content item on this page. These are the same steps you will follow to insert other item types on the page, with the exception of the \u201ccontent filter\u201d type. Content Filters work differently than the other item types, and will be dealt with separately.\n\n\nFrom the edit window for a page, you can click on an insertion button( ) to launch the page insertion wizard. This will open a new browser window, with the first set of options.\n\n\nStep 1:\n The first choice you make is whether you want to insert an existing item, or create a new item. Most of the time you will be inserting an existing item, so choose that option and click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\n\nStep 2:\n Choose the item type. There are several different types of items you can choose to insert. Each type is explained in the section of this guide devoted to the tools for that item. In most cases, you will be inserting a content item. Choose \u201cContent Item\u201d from the list and click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\n\nStep 3:\n Choose the site. If you are working in a single-site environment, you will not see this option. In multiple site environments, this option allows you to choose content from a different site. The selection defaults to the site you are working on, the option you will choose most often. Choose your current site, and click next.\n\n\nStep 4:\n Choose the content group. Content items are associated with groups, to help with organization (this is explained fully in the section dealing with Content Items). Choose an existing content group and click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\n\nStep 5:\n Choose the content item. Each item in the group you selected is listed in the menu, with the most recent item at the top. Choose a content item, and click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\n\nStep 6:\n The page insertion window closes, and the item you selected is added to the edit window. This item will NOT appear on the site until you click either the \u201cSave\u201d or the \u201cSave and Close\u201d button at the top of the edit window.\n\n\nInserting items of other types works in the same way. You narrow your selection options by making choices in each step, until the item you want is inserted on the page.\n\n\nContent Filters\n\n\nIn step two of the page insertion wizard, you are given the option of choosing a content filter. Content filters are unique, in that they are not a separate type of item that can be edited using one of the VitaSite tools. Rather, content filters are a powerful way of manipulating content items, so that a page is updated automatically every time a new content item is created.\n\n\nWhen you add a content filter to a page, you specify the content group(s) to insert, but not specific content items. Instead, you define the number of content items that will display in the content filter from that content group, and the filter always displays the latest content items from that group, up to the number you defined.\n\n\nAlso, the content filter does not show the full item. Rather, it displays the name of that item as a hyperlink, with an optional content summary if one is available. When a user clicks on the hyperlink, they are show the full content item.\n\n\nThe following steps show how to insert a content filter onto a page:\n\n\nFrom the edit window for a page, click on an insertion button( ) to launch the page insertion wizard. This will open a new browser window, with the first set of options.\n\n\nStep 1:\n Choose to insert an existing item and click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\n\nStep 2:\n Choose \u201cContent Filter\u201d from the list and click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\n\nStep 3:\n This step shows two panes. In the left pane, select the group or groups you want to pull items from by placing a check mark next to the group name. In the right pane, enter the number of content items that you want to display, choose whether or not to show summaries, and then type in the headline you want to display over this content on the page. Once you have done this, click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\n\nStep 4:\n The page insertion window closes, and the content filter you created is added to the edit window. This content filter will NOT appear on the site until you click either the \u201cSave\u201d or the \u201cSave and Close\u201d button at the top of the edit window.\n\n\nNow, all you have to do to update the content displayed in the filter is add a new content item to one of the groups you selected to pull from for this filter. As soon as you save the content item, it shows up at the top of the filter and the oldest item disappears from the bottom of the filter.'\n\n\nPreview\n\n\nDocumentation to come\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nClick on the properties button to edit the properties of a page. The properties of a page are simply pieces of information about the page, like its name and its position within the site. The properties page is shown in Figure 4. Changes made to page properties do not take effect until the \u201cSave\u201d button is clicked at the bottom of the page. Each of the fields is described below.\n\n\nPage Link Name\n \u2013 The page link name is used to identify the page in the administrative tools, and for any navigational links VitaSite creates to help your users find this page (such as the left navigation bar or in the breadcrumbs trail). This name should be descriptive, but short.\n\n\nPage URL\n \u2013 This shows the relative URL of the current page, in case you need to reference it for some external application.\n\n\nPage Title\n \u2013 The page title defines what shows up at the top of the user\u2019s browser window when they visit this page. This title should be consistent with the Page Link Name, but can be longer.\n\n\nLive on Site\n \u2013 This check box determines whether this page can be seen by your site visitors. If the page is not live (the box is not checked), then visitors to your site will not see this page and VitaSite will not create links to it. Once you make the page live (by checking the box and saving your changes), VitaSite will create appropriate links to the page and make it available to your web site visitors to see. This functionality allows you to work with a page in the administrative tools until you get it finished, without making it available on the site until it is ready.\n\n\nPage Order\n \u2013 This determines the order the pages are displayed in on the site and within the admin tools. If these are left blank, then the pages are displayed in the order in which they were created. Note that pages where the Page Order is left blank will appear before any pages where you have defined an order. Therefore, if you want to control the order of a section of pages, you must set the Page Order for all the pages involved.\n\n\nPage Template\n \u2013 This option allows you to choose a different look and feel for this page, if any have been defined. Typically, this option should be set to \u201cdefault.\u201d\n\n\nPage Group\n \u2013 This option allows you to assign this page to a page group. Page groups are used to control administrative access. The \u201cedit page groups\u201d hyperlink next to this option allows these groups to be defined.\n\n\nParent Page\n \u2013 This option allows you to move the current page, and any sub-pages under it, to a different part of the site. Choose the page from the list under which you want the current page to move. Site navigation will be updated automatically once you save this change.\n\n\nRestrict Access to User Group\n \u2013 Use this option to restrict access to this page. The default setting is \u201cNo Restriction,\u201d which allows any site visitor to see this page. The second setting, \u201cAny Registered User,\u201d limits access to this page to registered users of the site only. If you have defined any user groups, those groups will also appear in this list. Choosing a user group will limit access to only members of that group. When a visitor navigates to a restricted page, they will be asked to provide their username and password before they can see the contents of the page.\n\n\nAdd Link in Utilities Section\n \u2013 If your template includes a Utilities Link section, then checking this box will make a link to this page appear in that section.\n\n\nLoose Page\n \u2013 If this box is checked, then this page is removed from the normal site hierarchy and redefined as a loose page. Loose pages are not included in standard site navigational tools.\n\n\nShow Calendar Events from Group\n \u2013 If the template for this page includes the calendar tool, then this option controls what events show up on that calendar. The \u201cAll Groups\u201d option shows all events. The \u201cInherit from Parent\u201d option (the default), shows the same events as are shown on the parent page.\n\n\nMETA Description\n \u2013 This option is seldom used, but is still available. Advanced users can use this field to define the text that appears in the META description tag for the page. At one time, search engines used this tag to determine what search phrases were relevant for a given page. Many search engines still use this tag to show information about this page in search results. If no description is defined, then the page uses the META description tag defined in the template for this page, if any.\n\n\nMETA Keywords\n - This option is seldom used, but is still available. Advanced users can use this field to define the text that appears in the META keywords tag for the page.

Think of Pages as an outline of your site. The top-level is your home page. Under that you might have six or seven sub-pages that organize information about your company in a logical way. In turn, each of those sub-pages may have sub-pages under them, which further describe the information in that section.  For example, if we wanted to take this Users Guide and make it into a web site, then we might outline it into Pages and Sub-Pages as follows:   Home Page  Introduction   Overview  Pages   Content  Page Editor  Content Items  Media Items  Etc.  Etc.         You might notice that the outline looks a lot like a Table of Contents. That is the point. Organizing your site into Pages and Sub-pages provides an organizational structure that makes it easy for your site visitors to find what they\u2019re looking for.  Think of  content  as the \u201cstuff\u201d that goes on your pages. Content is usually text and images, but it can also be a streaming audio/video file, a PDF document, or something similar. Content is the message you\u2019re trying to communicate through the pages of your site.

At each step of the wizard you make a choice which narrows the options you see in the next step, leading to the last step of inserting a specific item onto the page. In this Users Guide, we will cover the page insertion wizard options that are common among all VitaSite installations. If your installation includes a plug-in, you may see additional options in the page insertion wizard.  In this example, we\u2019ll follow the specific options for inserting a content item on this page. These are the same steps you will follow to insert other item types on the page, with the exception of the \u201ccontent filter\u201d type. Content Filters work differently than the other item types, and will be dealt with separately.  From the edit window for a page, you can click on an insertion button( ) to launch the page insertion wizard. This will open a new browser window, with the first set of options.  Step 1:  The first choice you make is whether you want to insert an existing item, or create a new item. Most of the time you will be inserting an existing item, so choose that option and click \u201cNext.\u201d  Step 2:  Choose the item type. There are several different types of items you can choose to insert. Each type is explained in the section of this guide devoted to the tools for that item. In most cases, you will be inserting a content item. Choose \u201cContent Item\u201d from the list and click \u201cNext.\u201d  Step 3:  Choose the site. If you are working in a single-site environment, you will not see this option. In multiple site environments, this option allows you to choose content from a different site. The selection defaults to the site you are working on, the option you will choose most often. Choose your current site, and click next.  Step 4:  Choose the content group. Content items are associated with groups, to help with organization (this is explained fully in the section dealing with Content Items). Choose an existing content group and click \u201cNext.\u201d  Step 5:  Choose the content item. Each item in the group you selected is listed in the menu, with the most recent item at the top. Choose a content item, and click \u201cNext.\u201d  Step 6:  The page insertion window closes, and the item you selected is added to the edit window. This item will NOT appear on the site until you click either the \u201cSave\u201d or the \u201cSave and Close\u201d button at the top of the edit window.

            "text": "In step two of the page insertion wizard, you are given the option of choosing a content filter. Content filters are unique, in that they are not a separate type of item that can be edited using one of the VitaSite tools. Rather, content filters are a powerful way of manipulating content items, so that a page is updated automatically every time a new content item is created.  When you add a content filter to a page, you specify the content group(s) to insert, but not specific content items. Instead, you define the number of content items that will display in the content filter from that content group, and the filter always displays the latest content items from that group, up to the number you defined.  Also, the content filter does not show the full item. Rather, it displays the name of that item as a hyperlink, with an optional content summary if one is available. When a user clicks on the hyperlink, they are show the full content item.  The following steps show how to insert a content filter onto a page:  From the edit window for a page, click on an insertion button( ) to launch the page insertion wizard. This will open a new browser window, with the first set of options.  Step 1:  Choose to insert an existing item and click \u201cNext.\u201d  Step 2:  Choose \u201cContent Filter\u201d from the list and click \u201cNext.\u201d  Step 3:  This step shows two panes. In the left pane, select the group or groups you want to pull items from by placing a check mark next to the group name. In the right pane, enter the number of content items that you want to display, choose whether or not to show summaries, and then type in the headline you want to display over this content on the page. Once you have done this, click \u201cNext.\u201d  Step 4:  The page insertion window closes, and the content filter you created is added to the edit window. This content filter will NOT appear on the site until you click either the \u201cSave\u201d or the \u201cSave and Close\u201d button at the top of the edit window.  Now, all you have to do to update the content displayed in the filter is add a new content item to one of the groups you selected to pull from for this filter.

The properties of a page are simply pieces of information about the page, like its name and its position within the site. The properties page is shown in Figure 4. Changes made to page properties do not take effect until the \u201cSave\u201d button is clicked at the bottom of the page. Each of the fields is described below.  Page Link Name  \u2013 The page link name is used to identify the page in the administrative tools, and for any navigational links VitaSite creates to help your users find this page (such as the left navigation bar or in the breadcrumbs trail). This name should be descriptive, but short.  Page URL  \u2013 This shows the relative URL of the current page, in case you need to reference it for some external application.  Page Title  \u2013 The page title defines what shows up at the top of the user\u2019s browser window when they visit this page. This title should be consistent with the Page Link Name, but can be longer.  Live on Site  \u2013 This check box determines whether this page can be seen by your site visitors. If the page is not live (the box is not checked), then visitors to your site will not see this page and VitaSite will not create links to it. Once you make the page live (by checking the box and saving your changes), VitaSite will create appropriate links to the page and make it available to your web site visitors to see. This functionality allows you to work with a page in the administrative tools until you get it finished, without making it available on the site until it is ready.  Page Order  \u2013 This determines the order the pages are displayed in on the site and within the admin tools. If these are left blank, then the pages are displayed in the order in which they were created. Note that pages where the Page Order is left blank will appear before any pages where you have defined an order. Therefore, if you want to control the order of a section of pages, you must set the Page Order for all the pages involved.  Page Template  \u2013 This option allows you to choose a different look and feel for this page, if any have been defined. Typically, this option should be set to \u201cdefault.\u201d  Page Group  \u2013 This option allows you to assign this page to a page group. Page groups are used to control administrative access. The \u201cedit page groups\u201d hyperlink next to this option allows these groups to be defined.  Parent Page  \u2013 This option allows you to move the current page, and any sub-pages under it, to a different part of the site. Choose the page from the list under which you want the current page to move. Site navigation will be updated automatically once you save this change.  Restrict Access to User Group  \u2013 Use this option to restrict access to this page. The default setting is \u201cNo Restriction,\u201d which allows any site visitor to see this page. The second setting, \u201cAny Registered User,\u201d limits access to this page to registered users of the site only. If you have defined any user groups, those groups will also appear in this list. Choosing a user group will limit access to only members of that group. When a visitor navigates to a restricted page, they will be asked to provide their username and password before they can see the contents of the page.  Add Link in Utilities Section  \u2013 If your template includes a Utilities Link section, then checking this box will make a link to this page appear in that section.  Loose Page  \u2013 If this box is checked, then this page is removed from the normal site hierarchy and redefined as a loose page. Loose pages are not included in standard site navigational tools.  Show Calendar Events from Group  \u2013 If the template for this page includes the calendar tool, then this option controls what events show up on that calendar. The \u201cAll Groups\u201d option shows all events. The \u201cInherit from Parent\u201d option (the default), shows the same events as are shown on the parent page.  META Description  \u2013 This option is seldom used, but is still available. Advanced users can use this field to define the text that appears in the META description tag for the page. At one time, search engines used this tag to determine what search phrases were relevant for a given page. Many search engines still use this tag to show information about this page in search results. If no description is defined, then the page uses the META description tag defined in the template for this page, if any.  META Keywords  - This option is seldom used, but is still available. Advanced users can use this field to define the text that appears in the META keywords tag for the page. At one time, search engines used this tag to determine what search phrases were relevant for a given page. However, few search engines use this tag now.

When the content item is used as part of a content filter, this field is used as the headline for this content item. Otherwise, site visitors will not see this name.\n\n\nLive\n \u2013 This check box determines whether this content item can be seen by your site visitors. If the content item is not live (the box is not checked), then visitors to your site will not see this item. Once you make the content item live (by checking the box and saving your changes), VitaSite will make it available for your web site visitors to see. This functionality allows you to work with an item in the administrative tools until you get it finished, without making it available on the site until it is ready.\n\n\nPrivate\n \u2013 This check box is only available in a multiple sites installation of VitaSite. If this box is checked, this item can only be used on the site in which it is created. If this box is unchecked, it will be made available for use on other sites in the installation.\n\n\nAuthor \u2013 This is an optional field used to identify the author of the content item. If the item is used in a content filter, the information in this field is shown to users as part of the content summary. Otherwise, site users do not see this field.\n\n\nGo Live Date \u2013 This is an optional field used to determine when a content item should appear in a content filter. It only applies to content filters, and does not affect the appearance of the content item when it is inserted on a page.\n\n\nExpire Date \u2013 This is an optional field used to determine when a content item should disappear in a content filter. It only applies to content filters, and does not affect the appearance of the content item when it is inserted on a page.\n\n\nSummary \u2013 This is an optional field used to provide a short summary of the content item. It is only used when an item is part of a content filter, and the content filter has been set to show summaries.\n\n\nOnce you have completed these fields, you will generally click the \u201cProceed to Editor\u201d button. This will save the properties, and take you to the next screen where you can edit the content itself. Clicking the \u201csave properties\u201d button will not proceed to the editor after saving the properties.\n\n\nStep Two\n\n\nEdit the content of the item. In this step you will work with the text and images that make up this item. This step uses a visual what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor, which allows you to control the appearance of your content item without having to learn HTML. An image of the WYSIWYG editor is shown in Figure 6.\n\n\nThe actions you can perform using the WYSIWYG Editor include:\n\n\nTypeface Menu: This menu allows you to select the typeface for you text. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\nType Size Menu: This menu allows you to select the type size for you text. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\nStyle Menu: This menu allows you to apply a style to your text using the styles defined in your site\u2019s cascading style sheet.\n- Undo: This button undoes the last edit you made. It remembers multiple edits, and undoes each previous edit each time you click the button.\n- Redo: This button redoes the last \u201cundo\u201d you made using the \u201cUndo\u201d button. It remembers multiple edits, and redoes each previous edit each time you click the button.\n- Font Color: This button allows you to define the color of your text.\n- Font Background Color: This button allows you to define the background\ncolor, or highlight color, of your text.\n- Cut: This button removes the selected text, and places it on the clipboard.\n- Copy: This button copies the selected text to the clipboard.\n- Paste: This button inserts the contents of the clipboard at the current text insertion point.\n- Align Left: This button aligns the current selection to the left.\n- Center: This button aligns the current selection to the center point.\n- Align Right: This button aligns the current selection to the right.\n- Align Justify: This button aligns the current selection using full justification.\n- Ordered List: This button allows you to create an ordered list. Place the insertion point where you want the list to start, then click this button once for each list item you want to create. Once you have created the list items, you can type the text that should appear next to each.\n- Unordered List: This button allows you to create an ordered list. Place the insertion point where you want the list to start, then click this button once for each list item you want to create. Once you have created the list items, you can type the text that should appear next to each.\n- Subscript: This button allows you to create subscript text.\n- Superscript: This button allows you to create superscript text.\n- Strike through This button allows you to create strike through text.\n- Insert Image: This button opens the image dialog box, which allows you to insert an image into your content item. Once an image has been inserted, its parameters cannot be edited using this tool.\n- Insert Hyperlink: This button opens the hyperlink dialog box, which allows you to create links.\n- Insert Line: This button inserts a horizontal rule.\n- Bold: This button allows you to create bold text.\n- Italic: This button allows you to create italic text.\n- Underline: This button allows you to create underlined text.\nThere are two tabs at the bottom of the WYSIWYG window, which switch between\nthe normal WYSIWYG view and the HTML Source view.\nTwo of the WYSIWYG tools ask for additional parameters when you click their respective buttons. These are the Insert Image tool and the Insert Hyperlink tool.\nWhen you click the Insert Image button the dialog shown in Figure 8 is opened. This dialog allows you to choose the image you want to insert, and to define the parameters for the image.\n\n\nThe \u201cImage Location\u201d box allows you to specify which image you want to insert. If you have previously uploaded an image using the Media Uploads tool, select the \u201cUploaded Images\u201d option. Then you can navigate to your image in the listing on the right.\nIf you are using an image from the Web, select the \u201cURL\u201d option and type the full address to the image you want to use.\nThe \u201cImage Attributes\u201d box allows you to specify optional parameters for your image. Once you have selected your image and assigned any optional parameters, click the \u201cOK\u201d button to insert your image into the text window.\n\n\nWhen you click the Insert Hyperlink button the dialog shown in Figure 9 is opened. This dialog allows you to choose the hyperlink you want to insert, and to define any optional parameters.\nIf you are linking to a page from your VitaSite, choose the \u201cLink\u201d option. Then you will be able to navigate to the page you want using the window on the right.\nIf you are linking to an external resource, choose the \u201cURL\u201d option and type in the fill address. Once you click the \u201cOK\u201d button your link will be inserted into the text.\n\n\nOnce you have completed your text edits, click the \u201csave\u201d button at the bottom of the WYSIWYG screen. If you do not want to save your text edits, click the \u201ccancel\u201d button.\nThere are two additional text editors available for advanced users. The first is a WYSIWYG editor based on the Microsoft DHTML control. This editor only works on PCs running Internet Explorer in a Windows environment, and is not a supported editor. It is provided as a convenience to advanced users.\nThe second additional editor is the text-only editor, which allows raw HTML to be inserted in a content item. This editor does not display content in a WYSIWYG window, and requires the user to be familiar with HTML.\n\n\nYou can edit existing content items by clicking the \u201cedit\u201d link next to the name of the content item you wish to change. The edit process then works in the same way as the creation process described above.\n\n\nVitaSite maintains a history of all revisions of your content items. Each time you save changes to a content item, the previous version is stored in the history file. You can access this version history by clicking the \u201chistory\u201d link next to the content item name. Each saved version is listed by the time and date that it was first saved. You can click the \u201cview\u201d link to see how that version of the item appeared. Clicking the \u201crestore\u201d link restores the content item to the version you choose.",

The bottom part of the screen lists your existing content items in alphabetical order. You can change the sort order by clicking on one of the other column header links. Next to each item is a check box that allows you to perform certain actions on one or more content items. The actions that can be taken are shown in the \u201cAction\u201d menu at the start of the content item listing.  You can also view a subset of the content items by selecting a group name from the \u201cDisplay content items from group\u201d menu, and clicking \u201cSubmit.\u201d This will show only those content items that are part of that content group.

In this step, you will assign descriptive information about the content item using these fields:  Select a Group  \u2013 This menu is used to assign this content item to a content group.  Name  \u2013 This is the descriptive name used to identify the content item. When the content item is used as part of a content filter, this field is used as the headline for this content item. Otherwise, site visitors will not see this name.  Live  \u2013 This check box determines whether this content item can be seen by your site visitors. If the content item is not live (the box is not checked), then visitors to your site will not see this item. Once you make the content item live (by checking the box and saving your changes), VitaSite will make it available for your web site visitors to see. This functionality allows you to work with an item in the administrative tools until you get it finished, without making it available on the site until it is ready.  Private  \u2013 This check box is only available in a multiple sites installation of VitaSite. If this box is checked, this item can only be used on the site in which it is created. If this box is unchecked, it will be made available for use on other sites in the installation.  Author \u2013 This is an optional field used to identify the author of the content item. If the item is used in a content filter, the information in this field is shown to users as part of the content summary. Otherwise, site users do not see this field.  Go Live Date \u2013 This is an optional field used to determine when a content item should appear in a content filter. It only applies to content filters, and does not affect the appearance of the content item when it is inserted on a page.  Expire Date \u2013 This is an optional field used to determine when a content item should disappear in a content filter. It only applies to content filters, and does not affect the appearance of the content item when it is inserted on a page.  Summary \u2013 This is an optional field used to provide a short summary of the content item. It is only used when an item is part of a content filter, and the content filter has been set to show summaries.  Once you have completed these fields, you will generally click the \u201cProceed to Editor\u201d button. This will save the properties, and take you to the next screen where you can edit the content itself. Clicking the \u201csave properties\u201d button will not proceed to the editor after saving the properties.",

This step uses a visual what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) editor, which allows you to control the appearance of your content item without having to learn HTML. An image of the WYSIWYG editor is shown in Figure 6.  The actions you can perform using the WYSIWYG Editor include:  Typeface Menu: This menu allows you to select the typeface for you text. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\nType Size Menu: This menu allows you to select the type size for you text. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\nStyle Menu: This menu allows you to apply a style to your text using the styles defined in your site\u2019s cascading style sheet.\n- Undo: This button undoes the last edit you made. It remembers multiple edits, and undoes each previous edit each time you click the button.\n- Redo: This button redoes the last \u201cundo\u201d you made using the \u201cUndo\u201d button.

These are the Insert Image tool and the Insert Hyperlink tool.\nWhen you click the Insert Image button the dialog shown in Figure 8 is opened. This dialog allows you to choose the image you want to insert, and to define the parameters for the image.  The \u201cImage Location\u201d box allows you to specify which image you want to insert. If you have previously uploaded an image using the Media Uploads tool, select the \u201cUploaded Images\u201d option. Then you can navigate to your image in the listing on the right.\nIf you are using an image from the Web, select the \u201cURL\u201d option and type the full address to the image you want to use.\nThe \u201cImage Attributes\u201d box allows you to specify optional parameters for your image. Once you have selected your image and assigned any optional parameters, click the \u201cOK\u201d button to insert your image into the text window.  When you click the Insert Hyperlink button the dialog shown in Figure 9 is opened. This dialog allows you to choose the hyperlink you want to insert, and to define any optional parameters.\nIf you are linking to a page from your VitaSite, choose the \u201cLink\u201d option.

If you do not want to save your text edits, click the \u201ccancel\u201d button.\nThere are two additional text editors available for advanced users. The first is a WYSIWYG editor based on the Microsoft DHTML control. This editor only works on PCs running Internet Explorer in a Windows environment, and is not a supported editor. It is provided as a convenience to advanced users.\nThe second additional editor is the text-only editor, which allows raw HTML to be inserted in a content item. This editor does not display content in a WYSIWYG window, and requires the user to be familiar with HTML.  You can edit existing content items by clicking the \u201cedit\u201d link next to the name of the content item you wish to change. The edit process then works in the same way as the creation process described above.  VitaSite maintains a history of all revisions of your content items. Each time you save changes to a content item, the previous version is stored in the history file. You can access this version history by clicking the \u201chistory\u201d link next to the content item name. Each saved version is listed by the time and date that it was first saved. You can click the \u201cview\u201d link to see how that version of the item appeared. Clicking the \u201crestore\u201d link restores the content item to the version you choose.",
