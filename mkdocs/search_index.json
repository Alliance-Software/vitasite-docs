            "text": "Welcome to VitaSite\u2122\n\n\nVitaSite is a set of tools that enable you to take control of your website. Now you can manage this critical communication channel without having to learn the technical intricacies of how the web works. After all, you don\u2019t have to know how a modern telephone system works to use a phone to communicate in your business; and you shouldn\u2019t have to know \nHTML\n, \nFTP\n, or any other Internet technology to use the web for communication, either. VitaSite makes managing your web site easy.\n\n\nSo relax. If you know how to use a word processor then you already know most of what you need to work with VitaSite.\n\n\nVitaSite is also extremely robust and powerful. VitaSite technology is in use on sites that handle millions of page views per day. As your web needs grow, rest assured that VitaSite can handle your new requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Tools You Can Use from Anywhere\n\n\nWe built the VitaSite Content Management System around simple, browser-based tools that you can use from any computer that has an Internet connection. In this way, you can update your website from your office, your kitchen table, or from a hotel room half way around the world. It requires no special desktop software. If you have Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, or just about any other modern web browser, then you have all the software you need.\n\n\nConsistent Look \n Feel\n\n\nVitaSite maintains a consistent and professional graphical look and feel throughout your entire site. When you create or edit content, you don\u2019t have to worry about making sure it looks like the rest of your site. VitaSite automatically wraps the look and feel of your site around any new content you create, and displays that content in the standard typeface and font size chosen for your site.\n\n\nAutomatic Site Navigational Structure\n\n\nVitaSite automatically updates your site navigational options as you add and change content. If you add a page to a particular section, VitaSite updates the navigation on all the related pages so that visitors to your site can find the new page.\n\n\nVitaSite also maintains navigational aids, such as the breadcrumbs trail feature, to help your site visitors understand where they are in your site structure. This makes it easy for them to find their way back to a particular page, or to understand the structure of your site content.\n\n\nCentral data storage\n\n\nVitaSite uses a high performance \nSQL\n database (it\u2019s not necessary to know what a \nSQL\n database is). This database keeps all your content in one place, and accesses it as visitors request information from your site. If your VitaSite \nCMS\n installation is hosted on Alliance Software\u2019s servers, then we backup your content every two hours. If you host site on your organization\u2019s servers, then your \nIT\n department's site administrators control the backup schedule.\n\n\nVitaSite does not store anything on your local hard drive unless you explicitly choose to put it there. So again, you don\u2019t have to worry about keeping track of the content you create. VitaSite takes care of that task, too.\n\n\nWe designed VitaSite to allow you to focus your energy on communicating your message, without worrying about all the other details that normally go into creating a website.\n\n\n\u201cSo, Why Do I Need this User\u2019s Guide?\u201d\n\n\nYou won\u2019t for long. However, a Users Guide helps with two things:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt helps you get familiar with the organization of the tools, and become comfortable with how terminology is used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt provides a reference to tools that you seldom use. You will find that you spend most of your time in the system using two or three tools. Occasionally, you will need to use one of the other tools. At those times, having a User\u2019s Guide close by is helpful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing the Administrative Tools\n\n\nThroughout this Users Guide it will be assumed that you have access to computer with an Internet connection, and that you are logged into your VitaSite as an administrative user.\n\n\nThe first time you visit the administrative page each day, you will be asked to log in using your username and password. For the next visit that day from the same computer, you will not need to log in.\n\n\nIf you need to explicitly log out (e.g., when you are working from a computer that others can get access to), you can click the \u201clogout\u201d link that appears in the top right corner of each administrative page. This logs you out of the system, and returns the browser to the home page of your site.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nTo get started, first you need to know whether your VitaSite installation supports a single website or multiple websites. There are instructions for both types of installations below. If you do not know this information, contact your support team for help.\n\n\n\n\nAdministrative Access on Single Site Installations\n\n\nLogging in to your VitaSite is simple: just add \u201c/admin\u201d to the end of your site \nURL\n. As an example, if your site \nURL\n were: \nhttp://www.mysite.com\n\n\nThen you would log in to your administrative tools by going to: \nhttp://www.mysite.com/admin\n\n\nAdministrative Access on Multi-site Installations\n\n\nLogging in to your VitaSite mulit-site installation takes and extra step. First, a 'shortname' is given to each sub-site underneath the main or home site. As an example, if your site 'stortname' was the word 'site' then your \nURL\n would be: \nhttp://www.mysite.com/site\n\n\nThen you would log in to your administrative tools by going to: \nhttp://www.mysite.com/site/admin\n\n\nFor access to the main site, use \nwww\n for the site's 'shortname.'\n\n\nCommon Concepts in VitaSite\n\n\nThere are several concepts in which you might want to familiarize your self with as you learn to use the VitaSite content management system. These concepts are described below. However, don't worry, we'll link back to this page whenever there is a core concept you might need to know.\n\n\nGroups\n\n\nGroups\n are a way to organize your content. You can think about groups as you would a file folder on either your desktop or in your physical desk. For instance in \nMedia Uploads\n you may choose to organize your files into groups such as \"Images\", \"\nPDFs\n\", \"Headshots\" or any number of groups.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nMost tools only allow for a single group to be applied to items within that tool.\n\n\n\n\nGroups can also used in connection with \nFilters\n. Following our example above, if a admin would like to create a list of \nPDFs\n that users could access, a Filter could be used to display uploaded files from the \"\nPDFs\n\" group on a page on your site. More information can be found in the \nFilters section\n and within the specific filter documentation on each tool that support filters throughout this guide.\n\n\nFilters\n\n\nFilters\n are unique, in that they are not a separate type of item that can be edited using one of the VitaSite tools. Rather, filters are a powerful way of manipulating items with a tool, so that a page is updated automatically every time a new item is created with that tool.\n\n\nWhen you add a filter to a page, you specify the group(s) to insert, but not specific items. Instead, you define the number of  items that will display in the filter from that group, and the filter always displays the latest content items from that group, up to the number you defined. Also, the content filter does not show the full item. Rather, it displays the name of that item as a hyperlink. When a user clicks on the hyperlink, they are show the full item. Filters have different options depending on what tool they filter, such as options to Show/Hide dates, summary information, pagination, etc. Additional information specifically pertaining to filters are included within each tool's section of this manual.\n\n\nFilters can also be used to share items across multiple sites with \nTags\n, if applicable. Tags are a method to filter specific items out of a group, only displaying the ones that relate to the topics you would like to filter. You would choose to filter groups from multiple sites and instead of showing all the items, the tags would only show those within those groups that contain the tag(s) chosen.\n\n\nPrivate\n\n\nPrivate\n is a designation that applies only on multi-site installations, where an admin of Site A can access items from Site B, and so on. Private locks this item so it cannot be accessed outside this site. For instance, user permissions can be set up to allow an admin of a parent site access to site content from a child site and vice versa. Contact your site support team for more information on setting up user permissions to allow cross-site item access.\n\n\nIn the instance of \nfilters\n, private can prevent another site from pulling in items from your site. This could be useful if, say, you want a calendar event only to show on your site and not on another site's event filter, which incorporates your event groups.\n\n\nAbout This Users Guide\n\n\nWe organized this Users Guide in the same organizational structure as the VitaSite administrative tools. Each VitaSite tool has its own section, where we explain the use of that tool. We discuss the most often used tools first. Most readers of this Users Guide will learn the bulk of what they need in the sections discussing the first three tools: \nPages\n, \nContent Items\n, and \nMedia Uploads\n.",

            "text": "Pages \n Content\n\n\nWith VitaSite\u2122, you organize your web site using Pages and Content. Pages are placeholders for information. \nContent\n is the information you put on those pages.\n\n\nThink of Pages as an outline of your site. The top-level is your home page. Under that you might have six or seven sub-pages that organize information about your company in a logical way. In turn, each of those sub-pages may have sub-pages under them, which further describe the information in that section.\n\n\nFor example, if we wanted to take this Users Guide and make it into a web site, then we might outline it into Pages and Sub-Pages as follows:\n\n\n\n\nHome Page\n\n\nPages\n\n\nContent Items\n\n\nMedia Uploads\n\n\nEtc.\n\n\nEtc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might notice that the outline looks a lot like a Table of Contents. That is the point. Organizing your site into Pages and Sub-pages provides an organizational structure that makes it easy for your site visitors to find what they\u2019re looking for.\n\n\nThink of \ncontent\n as the \u201cstuff\u201d that goes on your pages. Content is usually text and images, but it can also be a streaming audio/video file, a \nPDF\n document, or something similar. Content is the message you\u2019re trying to communicate through the pages of your site.\n\n\nThe tools described in the rest of this section allow you to manipulate pages and various types of content.\n\n\nPage Editor\n\n\nThe admin uses the Page Editor tool to create pages, edit page properties, edit the content on a page, preview pages and delete pages. You can get access to the Page Editor by clicking on the \u201cPages\u201d link in the left navigation bar with the \"Content\" section on any administrative page. Alternatively, you can click on the \u201cPages\" link in the body of the main administrative screen.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nYou can see a representation of the main Page Editor screen in Figure 1. On this screen you can see all the pages in your site. The pages are arranged in a tree structure, with related pages grouped together, and with sub-pages indented under their respective parent pages. This arrangement makes it easy for you to find the page you need, and it helps you keep the content of your site organized.\n\n\nNext to each page is a group of up to five buttons. Each button performs a specific function, as follows:\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n:\n This button allows you edit the content that appears on the page.\n\n\nPreview\n:\n This allows you to preview a page and includes controls to allow for testing of a responsive website.\n\n\nProperties\n:\n This button allows you to edit the properties of the page.\n\n\nAdd Sub-Page\n:\n This button adds a sub-page under the current page.\n\n\nDelete\n:\n This button deletes the current page from the site.\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\n\nClick on the edit button to add, arrange or delete the content that appears on a specific page. When you click the button, a new browser window will open showing a representation of what the page will look like to your site visitors.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nThere are two buttons at the top of this page (see Figure 2) labeled \u201cSave\u201d and \u201cCancel.\u201d Each button performs the following function:\n\n\n\n\nSave\n \u2013 Saves any changes you have made to the page, and closes the edit window\n\n\nCancel\n \u2013 Discards any changes, and closes the edit window\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nOn any given page there will be one or more areas, called content areas, which you can edit. If no items are on the page, the tool bar only displays an 'Add Item\" button (see Figure 3), meaning that the only action you can take is to add an item to the page.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nIf there are existing items on a page, these areas are indicated by small numbers in the top left-hand side of each 'content' block. If you hover, or tap on a mobile device, a red outline will appear with an associated toolbar with each content item. gray header, as shown in Figure 4. Inside the content area there is a toolbar associated with each content item. There can be multiple items on a page, and each item will have its own toolbar. The full toolbar contains the following buttons:\n\n\n\n\nWidth:\n Sets the item to a specific width to achieve a 'column' effect. See note below.\n\n\nMove To:\n Allows reordering of items on a page within a specific content zone. Set the number of the content item you want to move the existing one to. All other content items on the page shift downward.\n\n\nAdd Item:\n Add additional items to this page. Brings up the 'Add Item' dialog box.\n\n\nRemove Item:\n This button removes this item from the page. However, it does not delete the item from the system. The item can still be used on other pages.\n\n\nEdit Item:\n This button (which may not be available for every item type) opens the editor for that specific item type.\n\n\nInfo:\n This button identifies the item by Group, Item Name, and Item Key. This information may be helpful to your site administrator in the case you get stuck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe \nWidth\n button allows you to add 'column' effects for your content. By default, all content items placed on a page will take up the 'full-width' of the content area. Your VitaSite installation may have one or more options under this menu. The \nCMS\n will automatically determine the width and number of items of each row, using the widths you assign to each item. For instance placing two content items with their width set to one-half (1/2) will result in a two-column effect. Any items that overflow the row will automatically drop under items in the current row. Be careful not to leave a row with an empty space or to make items too small where they might be usable to your users (e.g. Email Forms or Event Registrations).\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember that changes you make using these buttons are not saved until you click \nSave\n or at the top of the window, with the exception of changes made with the \nEdit Item\n button. This allows you to experiment with various items, without committing to those experiments until you are satisfied with the appearance of the page.\n\n\nThe Page Insertion Wizard\n\n\nThe page insertion wizard allows you to quickly locate an item that you want to insert on the page. At each step of the wizard you make a choice which narrows the options you see in the next step, leading to the last step of inserting a specific item onto the page. In this Users Guide, we will cover the page insertion wizard options that are common among all VitaSite installations. If your installation includes a plug-in, you may see additional options in the page insertion wizard.\n\n\nIn this example, we\u2019ll follow the specific options for inserting a content item on this page. These are the same steps you will follow to insert other item types on the page, with the exception of the \u201cfilter\u201d type. \nFilters\n work differently than the other item types, \nand will be dealt with separately\n.\n\n\nFrom the edit window for a page, you can click on an 'Add Item' button (either directly on a page or within an existing content item) to launch the page insertion wizard. This will open a new dialog window, with the first set of options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1:\n Choose the item type. There are several different types of items you can choose to insert. Each type is explained in the section of this guide devoted to the tools for that item. In most cases, you will be inserting a content item. For practice, choose \nContent Item\n from the list. The dialog will automatically go to the next page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n Start typing the name of the item in the field at the top. The \nCMS\n will search through all items within that tool and retrieve the ones based upon your text. You may know this as an autocomplete or type-ahead function. Select the entry and then choose \nAdd Item\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nChoose the site. If you are working in a single-site environment, you will not see this option. In multiple site environments, this option allows you to choose content from a different site. The selection defaults to the site you are working on, the option you will choose most often. If you do select a different site, the dialog will refresh and the items from that tool will appear in the dialog box from Step 2.\n\n\n\n\nThe page insertion window closes, and the item you selected is added to the edit window. This item will not appear on the site until you click the \nSave\n button at the top of the page editor window.\n\n\nInserting items of other types works in the same way. You narrow your selection options by making choices in each step, until the item you want is inserted on the page.\n\n\nFilters\n\n\nIn step two of the page insertion wizard, you are given the option of choosing a one or more filters. You may want to \nlearn about the general concepts of filters\n, before adding your first filter. The following steps show how to insert a \nContent Filter\n on a page:\n\n\nFrom the edit window for a page, click on an \nAdd Item\n button to launch the page insertion wizard. This will open a new browser window, with the first set of options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1:\n Choose \u201cContent Filter\u201d from the list and click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n This step shows two panes. In the left pane, select the group or groups you want to pull items from by placing a check mark next to the group name. In the right pane, enter the number of content items that you want to display, choose whether or not to show summaries, and then type in the headline you want to display over this content on the page. Once you have done this, click \u201cNext.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n The page insertion window closes, and the content filter you created is added to the edit window. This content filter will not appear on the site until you click the \nSave\n button at the top of the edit window.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, all you have to do to update the content displayed in the filter is add a new content item to one of the groups you selected to pull from for this filter. As soon as you save the content item, it shows up at the top of the filter and the oldest item disappears from the bottom of the filter.\n\n\nPreview\n\n\nIf your website is built with a \nresponsive design\n (i.e. the site \nresponds\n to different device widths) the preview tools allow the admin to view their webpage within certain pre-defined responsive break points. The tool works whether or not the page is live and is only accessible to admins.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nOnce you have chosen \nPreview\n from the page admin page, you're presented with a view of your page scaled to the current browser window. Choosing a size along the top bar will size the page down to that specific window width, so you may make sure your page works and your page content does not overflow. For instance 480 pixels (480px) is a common mobile size. Clicking it will resize your page to simulate devices whose screens are 480px wide. Choosing Reset will restore your page to the browser's full width.\n\n\nProperties\n\n\nClick on the properties button to edit the properties of a page. The properties of a page are simply pieces of information about the page, like its name and its position within the site.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nThe properties page is shown in Figure 6. Changes made to page properties do not take effect until the \u201cSave\u201d button is clicked at the bottom of the page. Each of the fields is described below.\n\n\n\n\nPage Link Name\n \u2013 The page link name is used to identify the page in the administrative tools, and for any navigational links VitaSite creates to help your users find this page (such as the left navigation bar or in the breadcrumbs trail). This name should be descriptive, but short.\n\n\nPage Title\n \u2013 The page title defines what shows up at the top of the user\u2019s browser window when they visit this page. This title should be consistent with the Page Link Name, but can be longer.\n\n\nGroup\n \u2013 Restrict Access to User Group. Use this option to restrict access to this page. The default setting is \u201cNo Restriction,\u201d which allows any site visitor to see this page. The second setting, \u201cAny Registered User,\u201d limits access to this page to registered users of the site only. If you have defined any user groups, those groups will also appear in this list. Choosing a user group will limit access to only members of that group. When a visitor navigates to a restricted page, they will be asked to provide their username and password before they can see the contents of the page.\n\n\nLoose\n \u2013 Loose Page. If this box is checked, then this page is removed from the normal site hierarchy and redefined as a loose page. Loose pages are not included in standard site navigational tools.\n\n\nParent\n \u2013 This option allows you to move the current page, and any sub-pages under it, to a different part of the site. Choose the page from the list under which you want the current page to move. Site navigation will be updated automatically once you save this change.\n\n\nAdd Link in Utilities Section\n \u2013 If your template includes a Utilities Link section, then checking this box will make a link to this page appear in that section.\n\n\nPage Order\n \u2013 This determines the order the pages are displayed in on the site and within the admin tools. If these are left blank, then the pages are displayed in the order in which they were created. Note that pages where the Page Order is left blank will appear before any pages where you have defined an order. Therefore, if you want to control the order of a section of pages, you must set the Page Order for all the pages involved.\n\n\nLive on Site\n \u2013 This check box determines whether this page can be seen by your site visitors. If the page is not live (the box is not checked), then visitors to your site will not see this page and VitaSite will not create links to it. Once you make the page live (by checking the box and saving your changes), VitaSite will create appropriate links to the page and make it available to your web site visitors to see. This functionality allows you to work with a page in the administrative tools until you get it finished, without making it available on the site until it is ready.\n\n\nPage Group\n \u2013 This option allows you to assign this page to a page group. Page groups are used to control administrative access. The \u201cedit page groups\u201d hyperlink next to this option allows these groups to be defined.\n\n\nMETA Keywords\n - This option is seldom used, but is still available. Advanced users can use this field to define the text that appears in the META keywords tag for the page. At one time, search engines used this tag to determine what search phrases were relevant for a given page. However, few search engines use this tag now. If no keywords are defined, then the page uses the META keywords tag defined in the template for this page, if any.\n\n\nMETA Description\n \u2013 This option is seldom used, but is still available. Advanced users can use this field to define the text that appears in the META description tag for the page. At one time, search engines used this tag to determine what search phrases were relevant for a given page. Many search engines still use this tag to show information about this page in search results. If no description is defined, then the page uses the META description tag defined in the template for this page, if any.\n\n\nSite Association\n - Overrides the navigation element of the page and associates this page's navigation list with the site selected. The page will be treated as a top-level page in the navigation and will not show in the list.\n\n\nOverride\n - This along with the next two settings are used in coordination. This option overrides the navigation element, turning this page into a link. This is useful when you want a user to click on the page and navigate to something other than a page. Checking the box will enable the two options below. If it is unchecked, the next two options are ignored.\n\n\nOverride URL\n - This is the URL that the user will navigate to when this page is clicked in the navigation list. This can be either a relative (e.g. '/somepage') or an absolute (e.g. 'http://www.vitasite.com') URL.\n\n\nLink Type\n - Controls how the link will open the URL above. By default, the URL will open in the same window, but can be changed to open in other ways (e.g. '_blank' will open the URL in a new Window or Tab depending on the user's browser preferences).\n\n\nSlug\n - If your Vitasite installation supports 'clean URLs' then this field controls the URL of your page. By default if the Slug is not provided one is created for you from the \nPage Link Name\n. Any text in this field is normalized to work in a URL, so spaces are converted to dashes ('-') and any characters not allowed in a URL are removed. Two pages on the same site cannot have the same slug. The system will try and create a non-conflicting slug for you by appending '-new' to your URL.\n\n\nMater File\n \u2013 This option allows you to choose a different look and feel for this page. This setting will default to your site default, but may be overridden.\n\n\n\n\nAdd Sub-Page\n\n\nClicking the \u201cAdd Sub-Page\u201d button immediately adds a new sub-page under the current page and opens the properties screen for the new sub-page. The options for a sub-page are the same as described in the Properties section above.\n\n\nIf you do not define the properties of the new sub-page, it will be listed as \u201cNew Page\u201d in the page editor until you either define the properties or delete the sub-page.\n\n\nDelete\n\n\nClicking the delete option displays a confirmation screen that asks if you want to delete or cancel. Choosing \u201cdelete\u201d removes this page from the site permanently. However, any content contained on the page is not deleted, and can be used on other pages.",

Think of Pages as an outline of your site. The top-level is your home page. Under that you might have six or seven sub-pages that organize information about your company in a logical way. In turn, each of those sub-pages may have sub-pages under them, which further describe the information in that section.  For example, if we wanted to take this Users Guide and make it into a web site, then we might outline it into Pages and Sub-Pages as follows:   Home Page  Pages  Content Items  Media Uploads  Etc.  Etc.       You might notice that the outline looks a lot like a Table of Contents. That is the point. Organizing your site into Pages and Sub-pages provides an organizational structure that makes it easy for your site visitors to find what they\u2019re looking for.  Think of  content  as the \u201cstuff\u201d that goes on your pages. Content is usually text and images, but it can also be a streaming audio/video file, a  PDF  document, or something similar.

If no items are on the page, the tool bar only displays an 'Add Item\" button (see Figure 3), meaning that the only action you can take is to add an item to the page.   Figure 4  If there are existing items on a page, these areas are indicated by small numbers in the top left-hand side of each 'content' block. If you hover, or tap on a mobile device, a red outline will appear with an associated toolbar with each content item. gray header, as shown in Figure 4. Inside the content area there is a toolbar associated with each content item. There can be multiple items on a page, and each item will have its own toolbar. The full toolbar contains the following buttons:   Width:  Sets the item to a specific width to achieve a 'column' effect. See note below.  Move To:  Allows reordering of items on a page within a specific content zone. Set the number of the content item you want to move the existing one to. All other content items on the page shift downward.  Add Item:  Add additional items to this page. Brings up the 'Add Item' dialog box.  Remove Item:  This button removes this item from the page. However, it does not delete the item from the system. The item can still be used on other pages.  Edit Item:  This button (which may not be available for every item type) opens the editor for that specific item type.  Info:  This button identifies the item by Group, Item Name, and Item Key. This information may be helpful to your site administrator in the case you get stuck.    Note  The  Width  button allows you to add 'column' effects for your content. By default, all content items placed on a page will take up the 'full-width' of the content area. Your VitaSite installation may have one or more options under this menu. The  CMS  will automatically determine the width and number of items of each row, using the widths you assign to each item. For instance placing two content items with their width set to one-half (1/2) will result in a two-column effect. Any items that overflow the row will automatically drop under items in the current row. Be careful not to leave a row with an empty space or to make items too small where they might be usable to your users (e.g. Email Forms or Event Registrations).   It is important to remember that changes you make using these buttons are not saved until you click  Save  or at the top of the window, with the exception of changes made with the  Edit Item  button.

At each step of the wizard you make a choice which narrows the options you see in the next step, leading to the last step of inserting a specific item onto the page. In this Users Guide, we will cover the page insertion wizard options that are common among all VitaSite installations. If your installation includes a plug-in, you may see additional options in the page insertion wizard.  In this example, we\u2019ll follow the specific options for inserting a content item on this page. These are the same steps you will follow to insert other item types on the page, with the exception of the \u201cfilter\u201d type.  Filters  work differently than the other item types,  and will be dealt with separately .  From the edit window for a page, you can click on an 'Add Item' button (either directly on a page or within an existing content item) to launch the page insertion wizard. This will open a new dialog window, with the first set of options.    Step 1:  Choose the item type. There are several different types of items you can choose to insert. Each type is explained in the section of this guide devoted to the tools for that item. In most cases, you will be inserting a content item. For practice, choose  Content Item  from the list. The dialog will automatically go to the next page.    Step 2:  Start typing the name of the item in the field at the top.

You may also search for a specific content item by using the \"Search by name\" field and searching on the name of the content item the admin provided.\n\n\nYou can \ncreate additional content groups\n, or edit existing groups, by selecting the \u201cEdit content groups\u201d link near \u201cDisplay content items from group\u201d menu. Learn more about \nContent Groups\n.\n\n\nCreating Content Items\n\n\nTo create a new content item, click the \u201cNew Content Item\u201d link at the top of the main Content Editor page. This will open a new wizard, and display the fields for the process of creating a content item.\n\n\nStep One\n\n\nDefine the Properties for the Content Item. In this step, you will assign descriptive information about the content item using these fields:\n\n\nSelect a Group\n \u2013 This menu is used to assign this content item to a content group. It is a required field.\n\n\nName\n \u2013 This is the descriptive name used to identify the content item. When the content item is used as part of a content filter, this field is used as the headline for this content item. Otherwise, site visitors will not see this name.\n\n\nLive\n \u2013 This check box determines whether this content item can be seen by your site visitors. If the content item is not live (the box is not checked), then visitors to your site will not see this item. Once you make the content item live (by checking the box and saving your changes), VitaSite will make it available for your web site visitors to see. This functionality allows you to work with an item in the administrative tools until you get it finished, without making it available on the site until it is ready.\n\n\nPrivate\n \u2013 This check box is only available in a multiple sites installation of VitaSite. If this box is checked, this item can only be used on the site in which it is created. If this box is unchecked, it will be made available for use on other sites in the installation.\n\n\nIf you are creating a regular content item, you can proceed to \nStep 2\n. The following options only apply to content used in a \ncontent filter\n.\n\n\nAuthor\n \u2013 This is an optional field used to identify the author of the content item. If the item is used in a \ncontent filter\n, the information in this field is shown to users as part of the content summary. Otherwise, site users do not see this field.\n\n\nImage Upload\n - This is an optional field used to identify a thumbnail image for this content item when it is used in a \ncontent filter\n. The content filter settings further describe how the image is used.\n\n\nPublish Date\n \u2013 This is an optional field used to determine when a content item should appear in a \ncontent filter\n. It only applies to content filters, and does not affect the appearance of the content item when it is inserted on a page.\n\n\nExpire Date\n \u2013 This is an optional field used to determine when a content item should disappear in a \ncontent filter\n. It only applies to content filters, and does not affect the appearance of the content item when it is inserted on a page.\n\n\nSummary\n \u2013 This is an optional field used to provide a short summary of the content item. It is only used when an item is part of a \ncontent filter\n, and the content filter has been set to show summaries.\n\n\nOnce you have completed these fields, you will generally proceed to the editor in \nStep 2\n.\n\n\nStep Two\n\n\nEdit the content of the item. In this section you will work with the text and images that make up this item.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nThe \nText\n block uses a visual what-you-see-is-what-you-get (\nWYSIWYG\n) editor, which allows you to control the appearance of your content item without having to learn HTML. An image of the \nWYSIWYG\n editor is shown in Figure 2. You can learn more about the editor in the \nUsing the \nWYSIWYG\n Editor\n section below.\n\n\nOnce you have completed your text edits, use the \nSave and Continue\n button at the bottom of the wizard to continue. If you do not want to save your text edits, select the \u201ccancel\u201d link.\n\n\nYou can edit existing content items by clicking the \u201cedit\u201d link next to the name of the content item you wish to change. The edit process then works in the same way as the creation process described above.\n\n\nUsing the \nWYSIWYG\n Editor\n\n\nBecause the editor can be customized from installation to installation depending on your requirements, an overview of the editor follows. Specific documentation on the \nWYSIWYG\n editor can be found at the \nCKEditor Docs\n website.\n\n\nIf you have used a word processing tool (e.g. Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Apple Pages) you already have a good idea on how to use a \nWYSIWYG\n editor, such as CKEditor. However the information below may be helpful if you are in need of a refresher, or cannot find information elsewhere. Generally, the actions you can perform using the \nWYSIWYG\n Editor include:\n\n\nEditing\n\n\n\n\nCut\n - This button removes the selected text, and places it on the clipboard.\n\n\nCopy\n - This button copies the selected text to the clipboard.\n\n\nPaste\n - This button inserts the contents of the clipboard at the current text insertion point.\n\n\nPaste as Plain Text\n - This button opens a dialog where text on the user's clipboard can be pasted. Any text, styles, etc. are stripped down to their basic formats before being inserted into the editor. This option is helpful if you want to start formatting from scratch or are pasting from a source that is known to cause issues with the CKEditor.\n\n\nPaste from Word\n - The CKEditor allows you to keep basic formatting when you past a text fragment from Microsoft Word. This option is recommended for any text pasted into the editor from Microsoft Word, due to its known formatting issues.\n\n\nUndo\n - The Undo feature is a quick way to cancel the recently introduced change and restore the document to its previous state.\n\n\nRedo\n - The Redo feature lets you revert the last undo operation. This means that the document returns to the state it was in before you performed the undo.\n\n\n\n\nView\n\n\n\n\nFind\n - Allows the editor to find the specific text in the document.\n\n\nReplace\n - Allows the editor to find and replace specific text in the document.\n\n\nSelect All\n - This button selects everything in the editor document.\n\n\nSpell Check As You Type (\nSCAYT\n)\n - \nSCAYT\n is a convenient option that lets you control the correctness of your document at the same time that you are writing it. \nSCAYT\n checks the text immediately after you write it and when it finds an error, it marks it with a red wavy line underneath the misspelled word. By default \nSCAYT\n is enabled. Any mistyped word may be corrected by right clicking (control+click on some Macs) and selecting the correct spelling from the suggested options within the menu. The toolbar menu has additional options not covered in this documentation.\n\n\n\n\nTypeface Options\n\n\n\n\nStyles Menu\n - This menu allows you to apply a style to your text using the styles defined in your site\u2019s cascading style sheet. This feature may be disabled or not utilized.\n\n\nFormat Menu\n - Described the paragraph format of the current line. By default the editor uses Paragraphs \np\n. This menu allows you to change the current line to a Heading 1-6 (i.e. \nh1\n, \nh2\n, etc.) or a Division \ndiv\n element. There might be additional options depending on your installation.\n\n\nFont Menu\n -  This menu allows you to select the typeface for you text. This option might be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\n\n\nSize Menu\n -  This menu allows you to select the type size for you text. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\n\n\nFont Color\n - This button allows you to define the color of your text. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\n\n\nFont Background Color\n - This button allows you to define the background color, or highlight color, of your text. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\n\n\n\n\nText Styling\n\n\n\n\nBold\n - This button allows you to create bold text.\n\n\nItalic\n - This button allows you to create italic text.\n\n\nUnderline\n - This button allows you to create underlined text.\n\n\nStrike through\n - This button allows you to create strike through text.\n\n\nSubscript\n - This button allows you to create subscript text.\n\n\nSuperscript\n - This button allows you to create superscript text.\n\n\nRemove Formatting\n - This button will remove all formatting from the currently selected text. It will, however, preserve any changes from the Format menu.\n\n\n\n\nText Layout\n\n\n\n\nOrdered List\n - This button allows you to create an ordered list. Place the insertion point where you want the list to start, then click this button once for each list item you want to create. Once you have created the list items, you can type the text that should appear next to each.\n\n\nUnordered List\n - This button allows you to create an ordered list. Place the insertion point where you want the list to start, then click this button once for each list item you want to create. Once you have created the list items, you can type the text that should appear next to each.\n\n\nIndent Left\n - Indents the current text to the left. When used in combination with the Ordered/Unordered lists, creates nested lists by indenting the current line down one level. If the last level is reached, it removes the list option from the current selection.\n\n\nIndent Right\n - Indents the current text to the right. When used in combination with the Ordered/Unordered lists, moves a list item up one level.\n\n\nBlock Quote\n - Changes the currently selected text into a block quote.\n\n\nAlign Left\n - This button aligns the current selection to the left. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\n\n\nAlign Center\n - This button aligns the current selection to the center point. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\n\n\nAlign Right\n - This button aligns the current selection to the right. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\n\n\nAlign Justify\n - This button aligns the current selection using full justification. This option may be disabled if your site uses a cascading style sheet.\n\n\n\n\nCreating Rich Text\n\n\n\n\nInsert Hyperlink\n - This button opens the hyperlink dialog box, which allows you to create links. See \nCreating Links\n section below.\n\n\nRemove Hyperlink\n - This button will remove a hyperlink from the currently selected text, if any.\n\n\nInsert Anchor\n - Inserts an Anchor to a specific point in the text. Links can then direct a user to a that specific point either within the current document or from another one. It is best practice to write compound words with no spaces or replacing spaces with dashes (e.g. 'content,' 'contentitems' or 'content-items') and no capitals.\n\n\nInsert Image\n - This button opens the image dialog box, which allows you to insert an image into your content item. See \nInserting Images\n section below.\n\n\nInsert Line\n - This button inserts a horizontal rule.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Features\n\n\n\n\nSource\n - Allows the user to switch between the \nWYSIWYG\n view and the HTML code view.\n\n\nPreview\n - Opens the editor into a new window, showing the current working state.\n\n\nMaximize\n - Maximizes the editor to fit the entire screen.\n\n\nShow Blocks\n - Outlines elements within the editor to show the structure of the document.\n\n\nSymbols\n - When you are writing, it is often necessary to insert characters that are not a part of the standard keyboard. This is especially useful during the creation of documents in foreign languages that require various national letters. Another area where special characters are often needed is writing mathematical expressions.\n\n\niFrame\n - CKEditor makes it possible to insert inline frames to a document. Inline frames, or \niframe\n elements, allow you to insert a frame containing another document in the middle of your document.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Plugins\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nNot all plug-ins available are listed here. This section includes some commonly included plugins in Vitasite installations. Please contact your system administrator for more information and options for the CKEditor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbed Media from External Sites\n - This Plugin allows you to insert embedded content (such as photos, videos, audio, and other rich media) via the OEmbed API. You only have to provide the \nURL\n to the site (It works also when the \nURL\n is shortened) you want to embed and the plugin does the rest. Examples of currently supported sites include: YouTube, Vimeo, Flickr, Instagram, SoundCloud, among several others.\n\n\n\n\nInserting Images\n\n\nWhen you click the Insert Image button the dialog shown in Figure 3 is opened. This dialog allows you to choose the image you want to insert, and to define the parameters for the image.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3\n\n\nInserting images directly in content is helpful if you want to be able to wrap your images around your text or to more closely direct the placement of your images in content.\n\n\nThe \nURL\n box allows you to specify which image you want to insert. If you are using an image from the Web, type the full address to the image you want to use in the \nURL\n field. If you have previously uploaded an image using the Media Uploads tool, select the \nBrowse Server\n option. Then you can navigate to your image in the window that pops up, shown in Figure 4.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nOn the left hand side of the \nBrowse Images\n window are your upload groups. You may have one or more of these groups. Choose the group in which you uploaded your image, and the right hand frame will refresh with thumbnails of the images within that group. You may select the image to insert by choosing one of the links below that image. The \nFull\n link will insert the image at full-size\nthe size you uploaded the image originally. The \nSmall\n link will insert a 100x100 pixel thumbnail and \nSmaller\n will insert the image as a 50x50 pixel thumbnail. These thumbnails are automatically created by Vitasite when you upload your image.\n\n\nThe additional image options in the image dialog are outlined below:\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Text\n - Text inserted as an attribute of an image that tells website views and search engines the nature or contents of an image. This attribute is recommended for all images.\n\n\nWidth \n Height\n - These fields will automatically be populated based upon your image's actual dimensions. You may want to use this information to verify that your image will fit in your content. It's not recommended to change these values.\n\n\nBorder\n - Allows you to define a border around your image, or to remove the border by using 0 in the field. This setting may override any site styles for your image.\n\n\nHSpace\n - Adds horizontal (margin) spacing to your image. This setting will affect both the left and right margins equally.\n\n\nVSpace\n - Adds vertical (margin) spacing to your image. This setting will affect both the top and bottom margins equally.\n\n\nAlignment\n - Allows the user to define how the image aligns on the page. \"\nnot set\n\" will allow the image to remain on it's own line without text wrapping around the image. \"left\" allows the image to align to the left of the page, with the text wrapping on the right. \"right\" does the reverse, aligning the image to the right side of the page, and text wrapping on the left.\n\n\n\n\nThere are additional options within the \nLink\n tab and \nAdvanced\n tabs which are not covered in this guide.\n\n\nOnce you have selected your image and assigned any optional parameters, click the \u201cOK\u201d button to insert your image into the text window.\n\n\nCreating Links\n\n\nWhen you click the Insert Hyperlink button the dialog shown in Figure 5 is opened. This dialog allows you to choose the hyperlink you want to insert, and to define any optional parameters. You may link text by highlighting it first, and then selecting the hyperlink button. You may also link images in the same manner.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nLinking to an external resource\n\n\nIf you are linking to an external resource, type your address in the the \u201c\nURL\n\u201d field. The link field should automatically strip and adjust your protocol (e.g. \nhttp://\n or \nhttps://\n) however, you may need to adjust the \"Protocol\" drop-down to match your intended destination.  Once you click the \u201cOK\u201d button your link will be inserted into the text.\n\n\nLinking to page\n\n\nIf you are linking to a page from your VitaSite, choose the \"Browse Server\" option. Then you will be able to navigate to the page you want using the window on the right. Then you can navigate to your link in the window that pops up, shown in Figure 6.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nContent Groups\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\nAs \nwith all groups\n, \nContent Groups\n, shown in Figure 7, allow for an admin to organize their site's content into to specific \"folders.\" Content groups can also be used to organize content for use in \nContent Filters\n. Each content group has an optional setting that allows you to specify an email address for a person responsible for that content group. When any change is made to an item in that group, an email notification is sent to that address.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\nThe options within a content group set up are outlined below:\n\n\n\n\nPrivate\n \u2013 This check box is only available in a multiple sites installation of VitaSite. When this check box is selected, this group is marked as private and will not be visible to other sites within the same installation.\n\n\nName\n - The name given to the specific Content Group.\n\n\nSend\n - Used in combination with the following \"Email\" field, enables email notifications when items within a group are added or updated.\n\n\nEmail\n - The email address or addresses notified when items are added or updated within this content group. Email addresses are a list separated by either a comma (\",\") or semicolon (\";\").\n\n\nDefault Content Tags\n - The \nTags\n applied to each content item by default. \nNote\n default content tags are only added when new content items are created, and are not retroactively applied or removed from content items.\n\n\n\n\nContent Filters\n\n\nDocumentation to come.",

The  URL  box allows you to specify which image you want to insert. If you are using an image from the Web, type the full address to the image you want to use in the  URL  field. If you have previously uploaded an image using the Media Uploads tool, select the  Browse Server  option. Then you can navigate to your image in the window that pops up, shown in Figure 4.   Figure 4  On the left hand side of the  Browse Images  window are your upload groups. You may have one or more of these groups. Choose the group in which you uploaded your image, and the right hand frame will refresh with thumbnails of the images within that group. You may select the image to insert by choosing one of the links below that image. The  Full  link will insert the image at full-size the size you uploaded the image originally. The  Small  link will insert a 100x100 pixel thumbnail and  Smaller  will insert the image as a 50x50 pixel thumbnail. These thumbnails are automatically created by Vitasite when you upload your image.  The additional image options in the image dialog are outlined below:   Alternative Text  - Text inserted as an attribute of an image that tells website views and search engines the nature or contents of an image. This attribute is recommended for all images.  Width   Height  - These fields will automatically be populated based upon your image's actual dimensions. You may want to use this information to verify that your image will fit in your content. It's not recommended to change these values.  Border  - Allows you to define a border around your image, or to remove the border by using 0 in the field. This setting may override any site styles for your image.  HSpace  - Adds horizontal (margin) spacing to your image. This setting will affect both the left and right margins equally.  VSpace  - Adds vertical (margin) spacing to your image. This setting will affect both the top and bottom margins equally.  Alignment  - Allows the user to define how the image aligns on the page. \" not set \" will allow the image to remain on it's own line without text wrapping around the image. \"left\" allows the image to align to the left of the page, with the text wrapping on the right. \"right\" does the reverse, aligning the image to the right side of the page, and text wrapping on the left.
