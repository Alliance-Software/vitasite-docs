                <h1 id="photo-features">Photo Features</h1>
<p>The Photo Features tool is used to upload several images that are related, and that are to be displayed in a mini-gallery format. For example, suppose you have several images from a recent open house event. The photo features tool allows you to create a gallery of these images called Open House. When a user selects the Open House
gallery, he or she will see a series of thumbnail images of the photos you uploaded.</p>
<p>When the user clicks on one of these images, the full-size version is displayed in a pop-up window. The user can then navigate to the next or previous image in the gallery by using the links that are created automatically for the gallery.</p>
<p>To create a new photo feature gallery, click the “New Photo Feature” link at the top of the main Photo Features page. This will open a new pop-up window wizard, and display the fields for the first step in the two-step process of creating a photo feature.</p>
<h2 id="step-one">Step One</h2>
<p>Define the Properties for the Photo Feature. In this step, you will assign descriptive information about the photo feature using these fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> – This is the descriptive name used to identify the photo feature to site users. When a photo feature is inserted on a page, the name, author, date and description are displayed as a text item. The name is a link to the thumbnails page for the photo feature.</li>
<li><strong>Author</strong> – This is an optional field used to identify the author of the photo feature.</li>
<li><strong>Date</strong> – This is an optional field used to identify the date of the photo feature.</li>
<li><strong>Live</strong> – This checkbox determines whether this photo feature can be seen by your site visitors. If the photo feature is not live (the box is not checked), then visitors to your site will not see this photo feature. Once you make the photo feature live (by checking the box and saving your changes), VitaSite will make it available for your web site visitors to see. This functionality allows you to work with a photo feature in the administrative tools until you get it finished, without making it available on the site until it is ready.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> – This field is used to describe the photo feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have completed these fields, you can choose either to save these properties without uploading images by clicking “Save Properties,” or to continue to step two and upload images by clicking “Add/Delete Images.”</p>
<h2 id="step-two">Step Two</h2>
<p>Upload your images. In this step, you control the images associated with the photo feature. You can do any of the following: upload images, delete images, or change the order of the images. The pop-up window now appears as shown in Figure 11. The upper pane allows you upload new images and associate descriptive text with each image as you upload it. (Note: this descriptive text cannot be changed once you upload the image.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File</strong> – This field allows you to choose the image to upload from your local hard drive. Click the “Browse” button, and then select the first image you wish to upload. Click the “open” button. This field should now display the local path to the image you selected.</li>
<li><strong>Title</strong> – Enter a descriptive title for this image.</li>
<li><strong>Caption</strong> – Enter a brief caption for this image.</li>
<li><strong>Image Type</strong> – Select whether this image is of the type JPG of GIF.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have entered the data for the first image, click the “Next” button to upload it. Once the image has been uploaded successfully, you will see a thumbnail version of it in lower pane. You can then choose to upload another image using the process described above.</p>
<p>The lower pane displays thumbnail images of the photos you upload, and allows you to change the order in which those images appear. Select the image you want to move or delete by clicking on its Title in the “Photo Order” box. You can move the image order by clicking the up or down arrows. You can delete the image from the photo feature by clicking the “X” button.</p>
<p>Once you have finished editing the photo feature, click the “Save” button. You can now insert the photo feature on any page by using the page insertion wizard in the Page Editor tool. </p>
