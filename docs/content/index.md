# Pages & Content

With VitaSite™, you organize your web site using Pages and Content. Pages are placeholders for information. Content is the information you put on those pages.

Think of Pages as an outline of your site. The top-level is your home page. Under that you might have six or seven sub-pages that organize information about your company in a logical way. In turn, each of those sub-pages may have sub-pages under them, which further describe the information in that section.

For example, if we wanted to take this Users Guide and make it into a web site, then we might outline it into Pages and Sub-Pages as follows:

1. Home Page
    1. Introduction & Overview
        1. Pages & Content
        1. Page Editor
        1. Content Items
        1. Media Items
            1. Etc.
            1. Etc.

You might notice that the outline looks a lot like a Table of Contents. That is the point. Organizing your site into Pages and Sub-pages provides an organizational structure that makes it easy for your site visitors to find what they’re looking for.

Think of content as the “stuff” that goes on your pages. Content is usually text and images, but it can also be a streaming audio/video file, a PDF document, or something similar. Content is the message you’re trying to communicate through the pages of your site.

The tools described in the rest of this section allow you to manipulate pages and various types of content.
