# Media Items

The Media Uploads tool is used to move various types of files from your local hard drive to the server hosting your web site, so that those files can be made available for use in content items and on pages. The Media Uploads tool allows you to upload image files, text documents, PDF files, streaming audio or video files, and other
document types.

To upload a Media Item, go to the Media Uploads tool by clicking “Media Uploads” in the left navigation bar of any administrative web page. An image of the main Media Uploads page is shown in Figure 10.

The top section of the main Media Uploads page allows you to upload a new item, using the following information:

* **Name (for Admin)** – This name identifies the media item once you upload it.
* **Text to Display When Creating Links to Media** – This field is used in only certain specific cases, where you need to insert a link to the item instead of inserting the item itself. In this case, this text is used as the hyperlink text. You can usually leave this field blank.
* **File Type** – Select the type of media file you are uploading.
* **Media Group** – Select the media group with which you want this file to be associated. You can create and edit media groups by using the “Edit Media Groups” link next to this menu.
* **File** – Click the “Browse” button to find the file on your local hard drive that you to want to upload. Once you have selected a file, this field will show the path to that file.

Once you have completed the necessary fields, click the “Upload” button to begin the process of transferring the media file to the server. This process may take several minutes, depending on the size of the file and your connection speed to the Internet. 

If the file takes too long to upload (typically more than 5 minutes), you will receive a timeout error. In this case, you can try to upload your file again after decreasing the file size, or by using a faster Internet connection. A timeout error usually indicates that a media file is much too large to be used reliably over the Internet. However, in certain cases you may need to upload a large file. In these cases, you can request that your network administrator upload the file for you.

The lower part of the Media Uploads page shows items you have already uploaded. Each item has a check box next to that allows you to perform specific actions. These actions are listed in the “Action” drop down menu at the start of the listing. The only action that currently applies to media items is the Delete action.
