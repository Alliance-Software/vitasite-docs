# Email Form Builder

Email Forms, sometimes called email response forms, are used to gather information from web site visitors. Visitors are asked to fill out a form, and the results are sent via email to you (or someone you choose) for action. Email Forms are often used on a web site’s “contact us” page to allow visitors to specify what they need, but can be
used to gather any information you need.

The Email Forms tool can be accessed by clicking the “Forms” button that appears in the left side navigation of all administrative pages. The main Email Forms page is divided into two sections. The top section allows you to create a new email form.

The bottom section allows you to view or edit existing email forms.

To create a new Email Form, click the “Create a New Email Form” link at the top of the page.

The first page allows you to set the following properties of the Email Form:

* **Form Title** This field allows you to set a title for identifying the form. This title is used in the administrative tools; it appears above the form on the web-site; and it is used in the subject line of the email sent when a user submits the form.
* **Email Address form will be set to** This field allows you to set the email address the form results should be sent to. When a user clicks the “submit” button, the data they entered on the form will be included in the body of the email.
* **Live** This checkbox determines whether this email form can be seen by your site visitors. If the email form is not live (the box is not checked), then visitors to your site will not see this email form. Once you make the email form live (by checking the box and saving your changes), VitaSite™ will make it available for your web site visitors to see. This functionality allows you to work with an email form in the administrative tools until you get it finished, without making it available on the site until it is ready.
* **Form Description or Instructions** This field allows you to provide information about the form, or instructions on how to use the form, to your site visitors.
* **Text to Display after Submission** This field allows you to provide a submission confirmation message to your site visitors. This text will be displayed after the user clicks the “Submit” button on your form. When you have completed these fields, click the “Save & Continue” button to proceed to the next page. This page allows you to setup the actual fields that appear on the form.

## Defining Fields

When you first reach the field definition page, you will see a set of instructions explaining how to use these tools as shown in Figure 12. You can view these instructions at any time by selecting the “Instructions” option from the “Please choose the type of field you would like to add” menu.

Using the tools on this page, you can create any of the following types of fields:

* **TextBox** This field type allows you to provide a single- or multiple-line text area. This type is used to collect data such as name, address, or phone number.
* **CheckBox** This type allows you to provide a checkbox that can be used to collect yes/no type responses.
* **Radio Button** This type allows you to provide a series or mutually exclusive options for a user to select from.
* **SelectList** This type allows you to provide a drop down menu of options for a user to select from.
* **Plain Text** This type allows you to insert descriptive text or instructions in the middle of your form. It is not used to collect data.

You can make any form field a required field by putting “\_req” at the end of the field description. For example, to make the textbox for email address a required field, change the description to “Email Address\_req” in the form editor. The “\_req” part will not be displayed to the users of your form. Instead, they will see an asterisk,
indicating that a field is required.

When you have created a field for your form, click the “add” button to place it at the bottom of your current form. As you add fields, the field definition page will update to show you the form you are creating. Each added field will have several buttons next to it. These buttons perform the following actions:

* **Move this field up:** This button moves this field up in relation to any other fields on the form around it.
* **Delete this field:** This button deletes this field from the form.
* **Edit this field:** This button opens the editor for that specific field type, allowing you to change the details of that field.
* **Move this field down:** This button moves this field down in relation to any other fields on the form around it.
* **Move To:** This button moves this field to a specific position in the form.

Your work on the field definition page is saved as you make changes. Once you have completed your work on a form, you can go to another administrative page, or log out of the system.

To edit an existing form, click on the “edit” link next to the form name. The process for editing your form is then the same as described above for creating a form. As soon as you complete your edits, the form will be updated on all the pages of your site on which it is used.
