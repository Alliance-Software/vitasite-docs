Polls & Surveys
The Polls & Surveys tool is an optional tool that can be installed on any VitaSite™.
This tool creates forms that look similar to email response forms. However, in
addition to emailing individual responses to someone for action, the Polls & Surveys
tools also tracks these responses in a summary report.
When the tool is used in Poll mode, you create a single multiple choice question. The
results of the poll can be made available to your site visitors.
When the tool is used in Survey mode, you create as many questions as you wish.
The results are not available to your site visitors. You can access the results via the
VitaSite™ administrative tools.
You can create as many polls or surveys as you like, and can have multiple
questionnaires running simultaneously.
If the Polls & Surveys tool is included in your installation, you can access it by
clicking on the “Survey Editor” link in the body of the main administrative page. If
the tool is not installed on your site and you would like to have it, please contact
your VitaSite™ representative.
The main Survey Editor page includes a section at the top where you can create a
new poll or survey, and a bottom section that lists your existing surveys. To create a
new poll or survey, click on the “Create a New Poll/Survey” link. This will display
the fields for the first step of the two-step process of creating a survey.
Step One: Define the Properties for the poll or survey. In this step, you will assign
descriptive information using these fields:
Survey/Poll Title – This is the descriptive name used to identify the survey to site
users.
Select a Group – This allows you to assign a poll or survey to a particular survey
group.
Require Login – This allows you to restrict the poll or survey to registered user of
the site. If a user has not registered, they will not be able to answer the questions.
Show Response Count in Results – This allows you to actual number of responses in
the results page. If this box is unchecked, the results will only show percentages, not
actual responses.
Show Questions above Answers – This allows you to format the questions to appear
above the answers. If this box is unchecked, the questions will appear beside the
answers. 
Live – This checkbox determines whether this survey can be seen by your site
visitors. If the survey is not live (the box is not checked), then visitors to your site
will not see this survey. Once you make it live (by checking the box and saving your
changes), VitaSite™ will make it available for your web site visitors to see. This
functionality allows you to work with a poll or survey in the administrative tools until
you get it finished, without making it available on the site until it is ready.
Private – This checkbox is only available in a multiple sites installation of VitaSite. If
this box is checked, this item can only be used on the site in which it is created. If
this box is unchecked, it will be made available for use on other sites in the
installation.
Email Responses – This allows you to send each individual response to a specific
email address. If this box is checked, each submitted survey or poll will be sent to the
address listed in the next field.
Email To – This is used to define the email address to which responses should be
sent.
Type – These radio buttons are used to determine if this item will be a poll (one
question where site users can see the results), or a survey (multiple questions where
only administrators can see the results).
Form Description or Instructions – When creating a survey, this is the text that will
be shown to a user that explains the purpose of the survey.
Text to Display after Submission – When creating a survey, this is the text that will
be shown to a user after they have completed the questions and clicked the “submit”
button.
Once these fields are complete, click the “Save & Continue” button to proceed to
the second step of the process.
Step Two: Define the fields. When you first reach the field definition page, you will
see a set of instructions explaining how to use these tools. You can view these
instructions at any time by selecting the “Instructions” option from the “Please
choose the type of field you would like to add” menu.
Using the tools on this page, you can create any of the following types of fields:
TextBox – This field type allows you to provide a single- or multiple-line text area.
This type is used to collect data such as name, address, or phone number.
CheckBox – This type allows you to provide a checkbox that can be used to collect
yes/no type responses. 
Radio Button – This type allows you to provide a series or mutually exclusive
options for a user to select from.
SelectList – This type allows you to provide a drop down menu of options for a user
to select from.
Plain Text – This type allows you to insert descriptive text or instructions in the
middle of your survey. It is not used to collect data.
When you have created a field for your form, click the “add” button to place it at the
bottom of your current survey. As you add fields, the field definition page will
update to show you the form you are creating. Each added field will have several
buttons next to it. These buttons perform the following actions:
 - Move this field up: This button moves this field up in relation to any other
fields on the form around it.
 - Delete this field: This button deletes this field from the form.
 - Edit this field: This button opens the editor for that specific field type, allowing
you to change the details of that field.
 - Move this field down: This button moves this field down in relation to any
other fields on the form around it.
 - Move To: This button moves this field to a specific position in the form.
Your work on the field definition page is saved as you make changes. Once you have
completed your work on a survey, you can go to another administrative page, or log
out of the system.
To edit an existing poll or survey, click on the “edit” link next to the survey name.
The process for editing your survey is then the same as described above for creating
a new poll or survey. As soon as you complete your edits, the survey will be updated
on all the pages of your site on which it is used.
To view the results of your poll or survey, click the “Results” link next to the
poll/survey name on the main survey editor page. A new window will open showing
the current results.
